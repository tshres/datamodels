Time Series DB is made specifically handle time-stamped or time series data. It has measurements that are tracked and monitored over a period of time. The data structure of Time Series DB a row-based storage model to organize the data and optimize it the best. It is different from the other data models since, other data structures use table based structures. Also, other data structures do not have time-based intervals. Time Series DB uses compression algorithms to strengthen performance and reduce space, which is another difference compared to the other data models.
